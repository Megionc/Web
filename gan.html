            <h5>History of Gans Puzzles</h5>
            <div class="text_gan">Gans Puzzles was founded in 2011 by China's 
                first national record holder Gan-Yuan Jiang. In 2014, the 
                company was officially registered with the new name GanCubes.

            <img class="image" src="images/gan_1.png" alt="">
            <div class="text_gan">The company regularly releases cubes, 
                embedding new amazing technologies into puzzles. The 
                manufacturer owns more than fifty patents, clearly showing 
                the originality of the technologies used.
            </div>
            <div class="text_gan">Gans Puzzles engineers pioneered an innovative 
                magnet positioning system, introduced the replacement of 
                magnets using capsules, created a new system for adjusting 
                the cross by replacing nuts, and other technologies. Sometimes 
                GanCubes are even compared to Apple Inc, only in the world of 
                speedcubing.

            <h5>Cubes 3x3x3</h5>
            <div class="text_gan">From 2011 to 2014, the company produced 
                cubes that at that moment could not compete with DaYan 
                puzzles. The first three Ganspuzzle cubes, as well as the 
                Gans 357 with a face size of 57 millimeters, did not impress 
                speedcubers as much as models from other companies. The 
                structure of Ganspuzzle I, II and III had unstable torsion, 
                and the elements constantly touched each other.
            </div>
            <div class="text_gan">At the beginning of 2015, the manufacturer 
                finalized their puzzles and released various variations of 
                the Gans 356. The cubes had an impressive angle cut, and 
                since then many cubers began to look at the Gans cubes.
            </div>
            <div class="text_gan">But since 2016, the manufacturer began to 
                regularly surprise puzzle lovers and seriously intrigued 
                speedcubers with its technologies.
            </div>
            <div class="text_gan">Until today, the company has been using new 
                technologies and each cube differs from the previous one in 
                individual chips.
