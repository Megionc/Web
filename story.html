		        <div class="text" id="Idea">The eye of the creator was 
                    attracted by an ordinary river pebble. It was thought that 
                    its sharp edges eventually wear down the current, 
                    rubbing stone against stone, until it acquires a 
                    simple and perfect form. And then Rubik decided to 
                    properly "grind" his cubes. Naturally, I had to 
                    discard everything superfluous. As it is easy to 
                    calculate, 26 small cubes have a total of 156 faces. 
                    Of these, Rubik boldly cut off more than a hundred 
                    and left only 54 outer faces: one-color for six 
                    central cubes, two-color for twelve side ones, 
                    and three-color for eight corner ones.

		        <div class="text" id="Erno">Erno Rubik, at that moment still an 
                    ordinary teacher, works at the Academy of Applied 
                    Arts in Budapest. Having made a cube model as a 
                    visual aid for teaching students, he realizes that 
                    he has invented a rather serious and interesting 
                    puzzle and a year later, in 1975, he receives a 
                    patent for it. The first batches of the cube were 
                    released in Hungary and sold in a toy store, due to 
                    which, most likely, not many people tried to deal 
                    with it seriously. Later, the puzzle spread to other 
                    Western countries, France, England, and the USA. 
                    Their debut took place, as well as in Hungary, at 
                    toy fairs, thanks to which the cube received the 
                    status of the same name there.

                        used for international competitions of a serious

                        style, under water, blindfolded, with feet, etc. 
                        In addition, there are many alternative puzzles
